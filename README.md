# Colonell-12.7-Ebaotech
Developed key backend modules including email notifications, PDF report generation, and secure data encryption using Java. Integrated external services and ensured secure communication between systems. Contributed to improving process efficiency and data security in a fast-paced agile environment.

This sample Java project simulates key backend functions from the Colonell 12.7 system developed at Ebaotech, demonstrating:  
- Email sending via API  
- PDF report generation (simulated)  
- Secure data encryption and decryption using AES  

## Modules
- `EmailService` — Simulates sending emails.  
- `PDFGenerator` — Simulates PDF report creation.  
- `SecureDataExchange` — Provides AES encryption/decryption of sensitive data.  
- `Main` — Demo usage of all modules together.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Java backend development  
- API integration concepts (email)  
- PDF generation basics (iText library simulation)  
- Data security using encryption  
- Clean code and modular design
